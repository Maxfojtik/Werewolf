# Werewolf

One Night Werewolf android app which removes the need for cards and shortens the night phase.
The app replaces the night phase and One Night app while keeping the exact same functionality.
Currently has support for all base roles, more may be added in the future

A guide to One Night Werewolf can be found <a href="http://howdoyouplayit.com/one-night-ultimate-werewolf-rules-how-do-you-play-one-night-ultimate-werewolf/">here</a>

To play, start by inputting the names of your group, preferably in the order you are sitting. If you don't input names, it will autofill with your player name and number. Next, select the roles you want. Then, pass the phone to the person whose name appears, which happens in the order they were added. The app will prompt you with a breif description of your role, although general knowledge of One Night Werewolf is assumed. After taking your role's action, click done and then pass it on to the next player. If you are playing with the Doppelganger or Insomniac you will pass the phone around twice, otherwise the night phase will require one pass. After the phone has been passed around it will start a 5 minute timer, for the day phase. After the day phase is the vote, and then the phone will display every player's name next to their role.

The app keeps the functionality of the night phase exactly, so it is the exact same game as with the cards.

This app was made my mdzirbel and Maxfojtik for fun.
Role select made primarily by Maxfojtik.
Everything else made primarily by mdzirbel.
