        <h2>Rules:</h2>
        One Night Cardless removes the need for cards and shortens the night phase relative to the usual One Night Werewolf.
        <br/> This app replaces the night phase and One Night app while keeping the exact same functionality.
        <br/><br/>

        One Night Werewolf Rules can be found <a href="https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules2/OneNightUltimateWerewolf-rules.pdf">here</a><br/>
        Daybreak rules can be found <a href="https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules2/OneNightUltimateWerewolfDaybreak-rules.pdf">here</a>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2>App Specific Rules:</h2>

        Start by inputting the names of your group, preferably in the order you are sitting, and hit Done. If you don\'t input names, it will autofill with Player #.
        <br/><br/>

        Next, select the roles you want.
        <br/><br/>

        Then, pass the phone to the person whose name appears, which will happen in the order they were added. Once the person whose name is shown has the app,
        they click READY to take their action. The app will prompt them with a brief description of the role, although general knowledge of One Night Werewolf is
        assumed. After taking your role\'s action, click done and pass it to the next player.
        <br/><br/>

        The app may require different numbers of times passing around depending on the roles selected, in order to ensure it is true to the original game.
        If you are playing with the Doppelganger, Insomniac, or Revealer you will pass the phone around twice, otherwise the night phase will require one pass.
        The Sentinel adds one pass to the above number, and having both the Sentinel and Doppelganger will take 4 passes
        <br/><br/>

        After the phone has been passed around it will start a 5 minute timer, for the day phase. After the day phase is the vote, and then the phone will display
        every player\'s name next to their role, and the unused roles at the bottom.
        <br/><br/>
